## Sales Forecasting with LSTM Time Series Prediction

### Overview

This project utilizes Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks for time series prediction to forecast sales data. The model is built using the TensorFlow and Keras frameworks, providing an accurate and robust solution for predicting future sales based on historical data.

### Key Features

- **LSTM Architecture:** Implementing a deep learning model with LSTM layers for capturing temporal patterns in sales data.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Includes data cleaning, feature scaling, and sequence creation for training the LSTM model.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Fine-tuning the model for optimal performance using grid search and cross-validation.
- **GitHub Repository:** The project is open-source, providing a comprehensive guide and codebase for sales forecasting.

### How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
